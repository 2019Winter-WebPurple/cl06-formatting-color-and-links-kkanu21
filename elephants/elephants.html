            <p>Of the two species, African elephants are divided into two subspecies (savannah and forest), while the Asian elephant is divided into four subspecies (Sri Lankan, Indian, Sumatran and Borneo). Asian elephants have been very important to Asian culture for thousands of years â€“ they have been domesticated and are used for religious festivals, transportation and to move heavy objects. Their staple diet consists of grasses, leaves, bamboo, bark, roots. Elephants are also known to eat crops like banana and sugarcane which are grown by farmers. Adult elephants eat 300-400 lbs of food per day.</p>

            <p>Elephants are the world's largest land animal. They are known for their large ears, tusks made of ivory and their trunks. Their tusks never stop growing - so the bigger the tusk, the older the elephant!</p>
